# FireWall

Firewall is an implementation of advanced firewall practices in Linux Iptables and FreeBSD pf.

It implements the basic Internet protocols, provides intrusion detection, servers, throttling, and blocking.

It is implemented as a shell script with parameterization through a per host configuration file.

Currently the linux iptables firewall is implemented. The pf FreeBSD firewall is coming soon.
