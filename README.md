# FireWall

Firewall is a statefull Linux IPtables firewall that implements the basic Internet
protocols, and provides intrusion detection, and blacklist support with a default
DENY policy.

It is implemented as a shell script and some aspects are hardcoded such as some network
addresses.

However with very little work it could be made more configuration driven using a language
like Python.

It does serve as a working example of implementing a multi-chain highly sophisticated firewall
for Linux.
